      <li> Player 1 always starts first. </li>
      <li> The player rolls the die repeatedly to accumulate round points. </li>

      <li> If the player holds, all the round points they accumulated at that turn will be added to their total score. </li>
      <li> If a player reaches 50 total points, they win and the game is over. </li>
